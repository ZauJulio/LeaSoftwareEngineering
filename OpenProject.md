## **Open source project management software**

#### **Efficient classic, agile or hybrid project management in a secure environment**

<br/>
<br/>

OpenProject is an OpenSource project manager used by technology giants.With it it is possible to implement and manage different types of projects, of different methodologies, with different sizes.

It is widely used in companies like Siemens, The Linux Fundation, Greenpeace, in addition to several others.

### **Installation**

Installation can be a little tricky on some operating systems, but if you are using Ubuntu, Debian, CentOs or Suse, you can count on packages already available and install easily:

</h3>
<br/>

If you are using more "caliente" systems like Arch Linux(üëèüéâ) or something closer to Shrek like Windows, you can perform the installation using Docker! I leave some options here that may help you:

<br/>

- [OpenProject: Docs Official](https://docs.openproject.org/installation-and-operations/installation/docker/)

- [In last case, Virtual Machines - OpenProject: Docs Official](https://docs.openproject.org/installation-and-operations/installation/univention/)

  - [Univention App](https://www.univention.com/products/univention-app-center/app-catalog/openproject/)

<br/>

Personally I use Arch Linux, it was the first time until today that I can't find the package in any Arch cumunity repository.However, I was able to install easily using Docker and following the official documentation tutorial.

Once installed it should start at:

<br/>

</p>
<br/>

<br/>

#### **Demo Scrum**

This is a demo of a project using the agile Scrum methodology, the presentation is divided into widgets of description, status, among others.

#### **Dashboards**

<p align="center"><img src="OpenProjectImages/demoScrumDashboards.png" width=384 height=216></img></p>
The initial project dashboard already proposes a series of filters for workload and general view of the project's progress over time.

#### **Planning**

Finally, the work packages, with filters such as Id, Subject, Type, Status, Assignment, Priority.

### **Conclusions**

<br/>

This manager is very light, practical and very complete, full of resources that can and will help you. In addition, of course, to have a simple installation, different from others like the Taiga, not to mention the super smooth learning curve. It is a good alternative to Trello, it goes beyond a simple digital board for you to nail your Post-it's.
